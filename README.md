# Process Reviews
</div>

## What is a process review?
At Makers, reviews are the most effective way to see if your processes are of a professional standard. They are conducted by [CoGrammar](https://www.cogrammar.com/).

This repository is a record of my reviews during my time at Makers.

## How a Process Review Works:

The Review is an hour-long remote session conducted via Zoom. The reviewer roleplays as a product owner with a set of non-technical requirements. The developer uses the Makers dev process to convert these requirements into a working, tested, well-written application.

The Review assesses how well a developer:

- Converts fuzzy, human wants and needs into technical requirements,
- Writes good tests,
- Writes clean code,
- Debugs when things go wrong,
- Delivers value to the customer in an Agile way.

## General Feedback

### Review 2

*"Your process demonstrated very good adherence to agile and
test-driven development principles and your process vocalisation was also
quite good! You could improve further by paying attention to your
red-green-refactor cycle iterationsâ€™ complexity and refactoring in the
refactor phases. That said, your overall your process was good!"*

### Review 1

*"This was a good first review and you showed a reasonable
understanding of what a TDD process should be. There are just a few
refinements that you can make. The main one being not to add production code
if you do not have a failing test for it yet."*
